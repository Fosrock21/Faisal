# Introduction

This project is a foundational Go library that provides a collection of common tools and utilities designed to streamline development across multiple projects. Serving as a base dependency, it encapsulates reusable components such as logging, validation, HTTP handling, messaging, and monitoring, ensuring consistency and reducing redundancy in codebases. By offering a modular and extensible design, this library simplifies the integration of essential functionalities, enabling teams to focus on building core features while maintaining high standards of reliability and efficiency across projects.

# Getting Started

1. **Installation Process**  
   Since this is a private repository hosted on Azure DevOps, acquiring the dependency is slightly more involved than a simple `go get`. Please follow the instructions detailed in the [Azure DevOps documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/go-get?view=azure-devops#go-get-with-private-projects) to configure your environment so that the Go toolchain can access and retrieve this module.

   After configuring the appropriate environment variables (`GOPRIVATE`, `GONOSUMDB`) and authentication, you can run:
   ```bash
   go get dev.azure.com/yourorg/yourproject/_git/myproject
   ```
   Update your `go.mod` file accordingly and import the relevant packages from `pkg/` into your code as needed.

2. **Software Dependencies**  
   The `go.mod` file specifies only the direct dependencies required by this library. Any transitive dependencies are automatically managed by the Go module system. You do not need to manually include or manage them.

# Build and Test

### Testing the Code  
This project is not a standalone application and cannot be "run" in the traditional sense. Instead, it’s intended to be integrated as a dependency into other projects. To verify that everything works as expected, you can run the test suite locally.

In the project’s root directory, execute:
```bash
make test
```
This command runs all available tests, ensuring that the library’s functionalities operate as intended. Since there is no application or service to run locally, the focus remains on verifying code quality through tests and then using this library as a dependency in your other projects.
